# Solidity-Encode-Gas-Comparison
As Solidity v0.4.24, new encoders are avilable abi.encodePacked, abi.encode, abi.encodeWithSelector &amp; abi.encodeWithSignature.  Got a bit curious and wanted to see the gas costs associated for each encoding method, for uint, address, bytes, bytes32, bool &amp; int variables.
